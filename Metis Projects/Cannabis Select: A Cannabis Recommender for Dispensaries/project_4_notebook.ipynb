Great for tension, anxiety,  and depression related symptoms. Melted the knots in my shoulders I had all day. Also nice for in the morning with a cup of coffee to get the brain fired up and ready to tackle yhe day.”\",\n",

Stoney, like all the Afghani hybrids but without some of the heaviness you get from, say, Afgoo.  Smells like a field of berries in bloom; looks are grade A nug porn.  Very frosty.  Also has a nice arousal quality.  It does have a bit of dizziness to it, and after three hours or so, it becomes a terrific sleep aid!”',\n",
