My final project at Metis concentrated on exploring unsupervised learning techniques to see what we could learn from women's college basketball statistics. I was interested in this dataset because the demand for sport analytics/metrics is constantly rising. This demand has produced a significant amount of impact on men's sports but womens' sports have been left untouched. With this knowledge, I thought it was extremely important to use machine learning to explore the number of positions in college basketball and see if these positions have an impact on team performance.
