## Project Objective ##

My final project at Metis concentrated on exploring unsupervised learning techniques to see what we could learn from women's college basketball statistics. I was interested in this dataset because the demand for sport analytics/metrics is constantly rising. This demand has produced a significant amount of impact on men's sports but womens' sports have been left untouched. With this knowledge, I thought it was extremely important to use machine learning to explore the number of positions in college basketball and see if these positions have an impact on team performance. 

#### Project Process

1. BeautifulSoup to scrape 12,000 NCAA players stats from 2017-2019
2. KMeans Clustering to find optimal number of positions
3. Principal Component Analysis and Tableau for interpretation and visualization
4. Analysis: Explore how these positions impact team performance

#### Project Findings

From K-Means clustering I was able to find 13 new positions. I placed these 13 positions into three tiers (low,mid,high). The tiers were based on position impact. Team perfomance was directly impacted by the prevalence of mid/high tiered players.
